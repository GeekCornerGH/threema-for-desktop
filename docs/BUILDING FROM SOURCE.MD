# Building from source
First, download Node. JS v14 from <a href="https://nodejs.org">here</a>. You will need at least v14 version. Then, clone the repository via <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Type <code>npm install -g pnpm</code>, go to the downloaded repository and run the following commands:
<code>pnpm install</code>. For the next step, you will need to run tsc, so just run <code>pnpm tsc</code>. Remember, you will need to run tsc every time you changed source code.
You can start at any time the project using <code>pnpm start</code>  

Finally, if you want to build binaries, just run <code>pnpm build</code>
